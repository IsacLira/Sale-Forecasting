# Sale-Forecast
This repo contains some codes for a sales forecast project.

This project aims to build a predictive model for sales forecasting. In our company, an deal / opportunity of sale can remain open for months. Our goal is to build a model to predict whether a opportunity will be closed or not, or, alternatively, the likelihood at each step of the sale pipeline. This information helps the sales vice president make strategic decisions.
